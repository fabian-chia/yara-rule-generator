- As you can see from this image, it asks the user what metadata the user wants to add
- It runs recursively to allow the user to add as much data needed
- The user is required to add at least 1 metadata for the yara file to work
- Addable metadata includes author, description of rule, last date modified and threat level

- The image above shows the script asking the user if they would like to use the yara file to look for strings within the malicious files
- The user is then required to give a variable name
- The user is also prompted to remember the variable name to be used later on
- This part of the script runs recursively to allow the user to add as many strings as they want

- The image above asks the user about what type of rule they would like to use on those strings in the condition portion
- This confirms if the user wants either of the strings or both of them in the file

- This image asks the user if there is a specific file type to look for
- The file headers of exe,elf and zip are already hard coded into the script such that any one of those file types would be detected in a yara script
